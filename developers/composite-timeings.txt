Introduction
============

Matchbox 0.8 has support for the new experimental X Composite
extension [1]. With Composite enabled, matchbox not just manages
windows but also display rendering adding effects such as drop shadows
to menus and much improved lowlighting effects.


Benchmarking
============

I've added some code to matchbox to perform a simple benchmark on how
fast the lowlighting effect can be performed using both Composite and
the admittadly rather crude XImage way.

One would expect Composite to be much faster as it avoids the amount
of client <=> server data transfer involved in the XImage version (
see wm_lowlight.c in wm.c ). Also if this performance increase in not
observered we know Composite and its dependencies ( eg Render ) are
not as fast as they could be.

The test [2] is triggered externally by means of 'mbcontrol -x', this will
trigger matchbox to lowlight the entire display ( method dependant on
compile time options ) and then output a timing in microseconds to
stdout.

    with '-use_lowlight yes'.
