Introduction
============

Matchbox 0.8 has support for the new experimental X Composite
extension [1]. With Composite enabled, matchbox not just manages
windows but also display rendering adding effects such as drop shadows
to menus and much improved lowlighting effects.


Benchmarking
============

I've added some code to matchbox to perform a simple benchmark on how
fast the lowlighting effect can be performed using both Composite and
the admittadly rather crude XImage way.

One would expect Composite to be much faster as it avoids the amount
of client <=> server data transfer involved in the XImage version (
see wm_lowlight.c in wm.c ). Also if this performance increase in not
observered we know Composite and its dependencies ( eg Render ) are
not as fast as they could be.

The test [2] is triggered externally by means of 'mbcontrol -x', this will
trigger matchbox to lowlight the entire display ( method dependant on
compile time options ) and then output a timing in microseconds to
stdout.


My Results
==========

The Tests were performed on an Ipaq 5550, running familiar unstable
and a freedesktop.org XServer built from CVS around mid December 2003.

10 Samples of each were taken.

XIMAGE LOWLIGHT TIMING: 228991 us

XIMAGE LOWLIGHT TIMING: 234413 us
XIMAGE LOWLIGHT TIMING: 226291 us
XIMAGE LOWLIGHT TIMING: 226388 us
XIMAGE LOWLIGHT TIMING: 225919 us
XIMAGE LOWLIGHT TIMING: 225206 us
XIMAGE LOWLIGHT TIMING: 234877 us
XIMAGE LOWLIGHT TIMING: 235797 us

COMPOSITE LOWLIGHT TIMING: 90359 us
COMPOSITE LOWLIGHT TIMING: 90663 us
COMPOSITE LOWLIGHT TIMING: 90010 us
COMPOSITE LOWLIGHT TIMING: 91935 us
COMPOSITE LOWLIGHT TIMING: 98831 us
COMPOSITE LOWLIGHT TIMING: 89809 us
COMPOSITE LOWLIGHT TIMING: 89574 us
COMPOSITE LOWLIGHT TIMING: 91103 us
COMPOSITE LOWLIGHT TIMING: 89673 us
COMPOSITE LOWLIGHT TIMING: 89692 us


Conclusions
===========

Composite is just over 2x as fast as XImage method - what was expected.

    with '-use_lowlight yes'.
